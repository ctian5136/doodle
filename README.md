# Description:
This is an implementation of the Doodle Poll scheduler, focusing on a user's experience in selecting which times work for them.

## Key Distinguishing Features:
- Doodle poll allows users to select "yes", "if need be", and "no" to show their availability to others. They do so by requiring 0 (for no), 1 (for yes), or 2 (for if need be) clicks of the avilability checkbox.
- Rather than a block of 15 minute time slots that change in opacity based on multiple people's selections, Doodle Poll lists each date and time in its own separate column and allows users to have a cleaner, more segmented view of the time slots.
- Differences not implemented here is the onboarding process. The organizer selects the date and times first that are then offered in the displayed view to the other participants to mark availability on. This process involves a calendar where they can put in the times by clicking, which creates a time block, and then dragging to extend or shorten it.
